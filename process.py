This one is the notebook's example feature, run over many recordings instead
of one: load a resting-state recording with the dataset's own loader, take the
Welch power spectrum of every electrode, and integrate 8-12 Hz to get absolute
alpha power in uV^2. Explore in starting_notebooks/bdf_exploration.ipynb, then
change this file -- it is the same computation, so the numbers agree.

It is a starting point, not a suggestion about what to study.
